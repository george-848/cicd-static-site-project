## Static Website CI/CD Pipeline

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to build and deploy a static website (index.html) using a complete CI/CD pipeline powered by GitHub Actions, Docker, and AWS EC2 (Ubuntu with Nginx).

It showcases skills in:

- CI/CD with GitHub Actions
- Docker image creation and publishing
- Automated deployment to AWS EC2
- Nginx web hosting on Ubuntu
- Infrastructure automation & cloud engineering best practices

## âš™Tech Stack

Frontend: HTML5, CSS3 (Responsive Design)
Containerization: Docker & Docker Hub
CI/CD: GitHub Actions
Cloud Hosting: AWS EC2 (Ubuntu 22.04)

Web Server: Nginx

## Project Structure & Architechture

## CI/CD Workflow

Push Code â†’ When code is pushed to main, GitHub Actions is triggered.

Build & Push Docker Image â†’ The pipeline builds a Docker image containing the static site and pushes it to Docker Hub.

Deploy to AWS EC2 â†’ Workflow connects to the EC2 instance via SSH, pulls the latest Docker image, and runs the container behind Nginx.

Serve Website â†’ Nginx hosts the containerized static website on EC2, accessible via the public IP or domain.

## Docker Setup

The Dockerfile packages the static index.html inside an Nginx container:

FROM nginx:alpine
COPY index.html /usr/share/nginx/html/

## Deployment Steps

GitHub Actions builds & pushes the Docker image to Docker Hub

EC2 pulls the image and runs the container

Nginx serves the updated website

## Key Takeaways

-Built a production-ready CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
-Automated deployments to AWS EC2 with Nginx
-Showcased knowledge of DevOps, cloud, and containerization
-Designed a scalable and maintainable portfolio project for recruiters
